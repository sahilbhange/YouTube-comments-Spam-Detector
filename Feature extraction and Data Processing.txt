Download a YouTube spam collection dataset available from below link:
(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00380/YouTube-Spam-Collection-v1.zip)

Data set attributes: 
COMMENT_ID: Unique id representing the comment, 
AUTHOR: Author id, 
DATE: Date the comment is posted, 
CONTENT: The comment, 
TAG: For spam 1, else 0

Approach:
1. Create single training data set file using the 4 of 5 YouTube data files.
2. Since the data set is text data, need to obtain the features from the comment(CONTENT) field.
3. From the data set only "CONTENT" field in the file is relevant to obtain the features.
4. Remove the unnecessary special characters (ï»¿) from the comment field.
5. Create SPAM dictionary of words which usually appear in Spam messages by observing Spam class samples.
6. Count the number of spam words in the comment using the spam dictionary
7. To check if the comment contains strings "http","www" or ".com" 
string which represent promotions and could be SPAM and set IS_HTTP=1 else 0
8. To calculate the ratio of Spam words to number of words in comment, 
first remove the English ‘STOPWORDS’ like (I,me,the,etc) from the comment field.
9. Get the length of the comment as long length comments are usually spam comments
9. Count the number of words from the comment after removing the stopwords.
10. Calculate the ratio of Spam words and total number of words in comment.
11. Execute the Naïve Bayes classifier on test data and validate it with the test data


New Features:

 SPM_CNT --> Spam words count in the comment
 IS_URL --> Flag to get identify high probability spam words
 COMMENT_LEN -- > Length of a comment on a YouTube video
 spm_len --> Total number of spam words in comment
 SPM_to_COMNT --> Ratio of number of spam words in comments to number of words in comments

The derived features will be used in Machine Learning algorithm to indentify the Spam comments on the YouTube.
